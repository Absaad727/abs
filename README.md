Final project for the Building AI course
Final project for the Intelligent home robot

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 
The home robot project aims to develop an intelligent home robot to realise home assistant, entertainment partner, information query and other functions through artificial intelligence technology and machine learning algorithms to improve the quality and convenience of family life.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.
In the daily life of modern families, more and more people need to rely on intelligent technology products to provide various conveniences. In the field of home robots, the problems that need to be solved include housework, entertainment, health monitoring, etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)
If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">
This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]
   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)
Home robots will adopt advanced artificial intelligence technology, including voice recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, etc., to realise intelligent interaction and service provision with users.

   # write your solution here
Continuously optimise the intelligent service ability of home robots through machine learning algorithms to make them more adaptable and intelligent.

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
The biggest difficulty is the combination of cultural creativity and industrial design. Technology is not just the realisation of functions. Many robots have the same function, but if you want to make your products stand out, you must integrate cultural and artistic content, so that the products will be more vital.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
## Acknowledgments
Improve the computing speed, perception ability and movement ability of the robot, so that it can better perform complex tasks.
Optimise machine learning, deep learning and other algorithms to improve the independent decision-making, learning and adaptability of robots.
Based on user needs, optimise product design and improve product ease of use and user experience.
Optimise the software and hardware system, improve the stability and reliability of the product, and reduce the failure rate.
Develop diversified home service robots, such as education, entertainment, companionship, etc., to meet the needs of different family members.
Cooperate with enterprises in home, education and other industries to jointly develop more applications and services suitable for home scenarios.
